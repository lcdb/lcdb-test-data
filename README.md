# LCDB test data

This repository stores small amounts of example data that can be used for
testing along with the code to reproduce the data.

It currently consists of 4 paired-end samples with FASTQ files generated by
flux-simulator using the sequence and annotations from the first 80kb of
chromosome 2L from FlyBase r6.11.

Each sample has two fastq.gz files (R1 and R2). Flux-simulator was run in such
a way that the R1 contains sense-strand reads and R2 has antisense. HISAT2 was
then used with default parameters to map the PE reads (`paired.bam` files) or
just R1 (`single.bam`).

To regenerate data, install this package and run `build_example_data`:


```
python setup.py develop
build_example_data -h
build_example_data data -j8
```
